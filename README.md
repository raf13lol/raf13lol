year age 14 of

i code a lot

that's about all i do

i mainly code in what i need to use

i can code in like c#, js, haxe, definitely more but too lazy (python for example idk)

any repo of mine that starts with `Xthing-` basically is just a "random" thing in/for X that i did/am doing (not likely doing)

that's about it

[my website](https://raf13.neocities.org/)

maybe i should add more, that's for later
